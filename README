This is a sample application that shows how to create a simple, unobstrusive to-do list which allows you to add and remove tasks.

I have recently been working to eliminate what I consider to be bad practices within rails for rich internet applications such as rjs templates, ajax helpers, link_to_remote, et. al
 
Most of the problems boil down to the default rails way not being a best practice anymore. Instead of obstrusive, ugly inline javascript I have opted to start learning various methods of unobtrusive javascript. This project is about trying jquery + lowpro for unobtrusive javascript.
